Attempting an LLM wrapper of sorts using Cursor for the first time

Idea is an extension that automatically/immediately produces relevant tailored insights (with your company's offering/value drivers/differentiators in mind) for any company or person you are looking at via any website

Basically trying to create something you can do with an LLM now but want it automated and without having to go to a new web-page/seperate page/etc.
